# **HPC Security Dashboard - Enhanced Logging & Visualization**

The HPC Security Dashboard project aims to enhance the logging and visualization of Kubernetes security metrics by integrating two powerful tools, Kube Hunter and Trivy. While Kube Hunter and Trivy individually provide valuable insights into the security posture of a Kubernetes cluster, they lack a comprehensive and visual dashboard for easy analysis. This project bridges that gap by creating a centralized and user-friendly dashboard to visualize the metrics generated by Kube Hunter and Trivy.

## **Installation**

### **For detailed installation instructions, including code snippets and screenshots, please navigate to the [setup.md](docs/setup.md) file in the project repository.**

To install and set up the HPC Security Dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine.

2. Install MicroK8s by following the instructions provided in the [official documentation](https://microk8s.io/docs/getting-started).

3. Once MicroK8s is installed, run the script [**update_deploy.sh**](scripts/update_deploy.sh) to install Trivy Operator and Kube Prometheus Stack Helm Chart automatically using the provided configuration files in the project repository.

4. After this run the script [**metrics_update.sh**](scripts/metrics_update.sh) with the **namespace name** to install our solution in the said namespace and deploy the service which will ensure the efficient retrieval and updating of metrics reports from Trivy. The reports will be made available through the designated output ports.

5. Set up port forwarding using k9s to enable access to the Prometheus, Grafana, and Trivy Operator pods.

6. Configure the datasources in Grafana.

9. Finally, import the [**HPC Security Dashboard**](Grafana/CIS%20FINALIZED-1686071432950.json) in Grafana.
