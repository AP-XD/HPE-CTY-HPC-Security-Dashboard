# **HPC Security Dashboard**

The HPC Security Dashboard project aims to provide a visual dashboard for monitoring and visualizing CIS benchmarks and vulnerabilities in a Kubernetes cluster using Trivy and Kube-Bench, which do not inherently have visualization capabilities. By leveraging Grafana, this project enhances the functionality of Trivy and Kube-Bench by presenting their metrics in an intuitive and user-friendly Grafana dashboard.

## **Understanding Trivy**

Trivy is a vulnerability scanner specifically designed for containerized environments. It analyzes container images and identifies any known vulnerabilities in their dependencies, providing crucial insights into the security posture of the containerized applications. It can also check whether Kubernetes is deployed securely by running the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark tests. It evaluates various aspects of the Kubernetes cluster's security configuration, providing a comprehensive report of any vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

**While TRivy is a powerful tool for assessing security in Kubernetes clusters and container images, they lack native visualization capabilities. This project bridges that gap by integrating Trivy and Kube-Bench with Grafana, enabling the visualization of their metrics in a consolidated and easily understandable dashboard.**


## **Key Features of the HPC Security Dashboard**

The HPC Security Dashboard provides the following features:

- **Automated CIS Benchmark Assessment**: Trivy is utilized to perform automated CIS benchmark assessments on the Kubernetes cluster, evaluating its security configuration against industry best practices.

- **Container Image Vulnerability Scanning**: Trivy scans container images for known vulnerabilities and provides a detailed report on any security issues found.

- **Kube Automate Solution**: Trivy and Kube-Bench metrics are collected and exposed by Prometheus, a monitoring and alerting toolkit, and a Node Server pod which serves the metrics report enabling efficient data collection for visualization.

- **Visualization in Grafana**: The collected metrics from Trivy and Kube-Bench are visualized in a Grafana dashboard, providing a consolidated view of the security posture of the Kubernetes cluster. This allows for easy identification of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations, aiding in proactive security management.

With this enhanced HPC Security Dashboard, administrators and security teams can gain valuable insights into the security of their Kubernetes clusters, making informed decisions and taking proactive measures to strengthen the overall security posture.

## **Enhanced Logging and Visualization**

The HPC Security Dashboard project provides a centralized platform for logging and visualization of security metrics. It collects data from Trivy, stores it in Prometheus, and then visualizes the metrics through Grafana. This approach offers a range of benefits, including:

- **Comprehensive Security Insights:** The integration of Trivy metrics allows users to obtain a holistic view of their Kubernetes cluster's security. They can identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and container-level risks, all in one place.

- **Real-time Monitoring:** The dashboard provides real-time monitoring of security metrics, enabling users to detect and respond to security incidents promptly.

- **Intuitive Visualization:** Grafana's rich visualization capabilities allow users to create custom dashboards, charts, and graphs to better understand the security metrics. This visual representation enhances the interpretability and analysis of the data.

- **Centralized Platform:** By consolidating security metrics from Trivy in a single dashboard, the HPC Security Dashboard simplifies the monitoring and management of Kubernetes cluster security.

## **Getting Started**

To get started with the HPC Security Dashboard, please follow the step-by-step instructions outlined in the [README](../Readme.md) file of this project. The README provides detailed guidance on setting up the necessary components, integrating Trivy and Kube-Bench with Prometheus, configuring Grafana, and visualizing the security metrics in the Grafana dashboard.

By leveraging the power of Trivy, Kube-Bench, Prometheus, and Grafana, this project offers an effective solution for monitoring and visualizing CIS benchmarks and vulnerabilities in Kubernetes, empowering administrators to ensure the security and integrity of their clusters.
